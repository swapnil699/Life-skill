# Tiny Habits – Reflections

## 1. What was the most interesting story or idea in the video?
The “Maui Habit” — saying *“Today will be a great day”* each morning as you put your feet on the ground.  
- Why it stood out:  
  - It’s unbelievably simple yet can reframe your mindset.  
  - A tiny ritual that sets a positive tone for the rest of the day.  
  - Proves that meaningful change often begins with very small, almost invisible actions.

## 2. How can B = MAP make new habits easier? What do M, A, and P mean?
- To create habits effortlessly:  
  1. Lower the **Ability** barrier — design the habit so easy that it requires little effort.  
  2. Use a strong **Prompt** — a clear trigger to remind you when to act.  
  3. Don’t lean too much on **Motivation**, since it fluctuates over time.  

- **MAP explained:**  
  - **M** → Motivation: your desire to do the habit.  
  - **A** → Ability: how simple it is to complete the habit.  
  - **P** → Prompt: the signal that tells you to start.

## 3. Most interesting story or idea
The transformation of the **British Cycling Team**. By focusing on 1% improvements in multiple areas—like sleep quality, equipment tweaks, and even hygiene practices—they went from being underdogs to Tour de France champions.  
- Lesson: Consistent micro-improvements can lead to massive long-term success.

## 4. Another story that resonated
Again, the **British Cycling Team’s** journey. It reinforced that tiny refinements, compounded daily, create extraordinary achievements.

## 5. The book’s view on Identity
- The core principle: *Habits stick better when tied to identity, not just outcomes.*  
- Example:  
  - Instead of: *“I want to run a marathon.”*  
  - Say: *“I am a runner.”*  
- When you adopt an identity, habits flow naturally to support it.

## 6. How to make a habit easier
- Remove unnecessary friction and design for simplicity.  
- Strategies:  
  - Start tiny (read 1 page, do 1 push-up).  
  - Organize your environment (place gym shoes near the door).  
  - Automate the process so it feels natural.  

---

## 7. How to make a habit harder
- Add friction and reduce convenience.  
- Strategies:  
  - Hide temptations (e.g., no snacks in sight).  
  - Add steps before you can indulge (log out of apps).  
  - Make the action slightly uncomfortable so you naturally avoid it.

## 8. Habit to build
**Reading daily for 10 minutes.**  
Steps to support it:  
1. **Cue obvious** → Keep the book on my nightstand where I’ll see it.  
2. **Attractive** → Pick topics and genres I’m excited about.  
3. **Easy** → Begin with a single page to remove pressure.  
4. **Satisfying** → Use a tracker or streak calendar to celebrate consistency.

## 9. Habit to reduce
**Mindless phone scrolling at night.**  
Steps to break it:  
1. **Invisible cue** → Leave the phone in another room before bedtime.  
2. **Unattractive** → Remind myself of grogginess caused by poor sleep.  
3. **Harder to do** → Enable app locks or require logins every time.  
4. **Unsatisfying** → Share progress with an accountability partner.
