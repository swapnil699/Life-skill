# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### Q1: What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?  
Sexual harassment includes unwelcome behaviour such as inappropriate comments, gestures, touching, sharing explicit content, or persistent advances.  

### Q2: What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?  
If I face or witness such incidents, I would immediately report them to the concerned authority or HR, support the victim if needed, and ensure proper action is taken.  
It is important to maintain a safe and respectful environment for everyone.
