The Feynman Technique is a way of learning where I explain a concept in very simple terms to check my understanding and find any gaps I need to work on.

**Q. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**<br>
The most interesting idea for me was the difference between focused and diffuse modes of thinking. I liked how it showed that taking breaks actually helps the brain solve problems better, and that rest is an important part of learning.

**Q. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?**<br>
Active mode is when the brain focuses deeply on one task and works step by step using logic and patterns. Diffused mode is a relaxed state where the brain makes wider connections and comes up with creative ideas.

**Q. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.**<br>
Set a clear goal, break the topic into smaller parts, prepare enough to practice, remove distractions, and commit to focused practice for at least 20 hours.

**Q. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?**<br>
I will practice more regularly, break down topics into smaller chunks, explain what I learn in my own words, and keep reviewing to strengthen weak areas.
